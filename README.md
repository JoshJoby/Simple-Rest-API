# Simple Go REST API
This Go code demonstrates a simple REST API using the Gorilla mux router. The API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of users.

# Requirements
Go (version 1.13 or higher)
Gorilla mux package (github.com/gorilla/mux)
# Installation
Ensure that you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Install the Gorilla mux package by running the following command:

    go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
# Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Start the Go server by running the following command:

    go run main.go
Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using a tool like cURL or an API testing tool like Postman.
